# Design
This repo serves as a home for experimental design projects, efforts, proposals, etc.

Design updates, especially larger ones, tend to spring up more often than they succeed. This is normal; it's a tough challenge! 

This is a public location for things to live while they're in the ideas phase, where folks can collaborate. Should a project in this repo reach maturity, it can be moved, an RFC created, etc.â€”whatever the next logical steps are to go from idea to official reality.
