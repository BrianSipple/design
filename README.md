# Design
This repo serves as a home for experimental design projects, efforts, proposals, etc.

Design updates, especially larger ones, tend to spring up more often than they succeed. This is normal; it's a tough challenge! 

This is a public location for things to live while they're in the ideas phase, where folks can collaborate. Should a project in this repo reach maturity, it can be moved, an RFC created, etc.â€”whatever the next logical steps are to go from idea to reality.

Currently, members of the Ember Core Team and Learning Team have permissions to manage this repo. New efforts should be on new separate branches, and community members should request new branches be created for their efforts as needed.

This repo exists in a somewhat middling state of officialness :p Think of it like a whiteboarding session. Something appearing here does not neccessarily indicate official approval, though some things here probably _do_ have the attention of the Core Team; it simply means that at some point someone on the team agreed that the initial form of the material was worth exploring. 

Should an effort reach the stage where it can be rolled into official Ember materials, it will likely relocate.
